# Todo List

A web app for me and my friends to keep track of assignments, quiz and the like

Thank Miscry for comparing this silly app to "a cozy tavern in the middle of a winter storm" <3 
That is my motivation right there! 

Please do play around and check out all the easter eggs ;)

Should be compatible to most browers and screen sizes

## Update Jan 08 2021

Vuex and Vue 3 made it a lot easier to react to user activities <br>
Made my own tooltip with CSS as well<br>
Check out the stats page for you stats :)

Todo list (meta)

- Delete the initial testing todos
- Make the stats page better looking
- Dark mode
- Drag to order todos (if even possible)
- Backend with mongodb if ppl want to store on cloud (why?)
- Hopefully turn the whole thing into typescript

## Functions

- Kindly greets you with random phrases
- Store todos in cookies
- Horizontal / Vertical layouts
- Undo / Redo
- Drag and drop (with html)
- Keyboard shortcuts & Tooltips
  - undo: ctrl+z
  - redo: ctrl+shift+z
  - delete todo: right click
- Countless useless easter eggs

## Vue

somebody may ask: "why don't you learn react or angular?"

well, they both look ugly, whereas vue looks amazing
