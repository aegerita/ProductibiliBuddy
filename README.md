# ProductibiliBuddy

A web app for me and my friends to keep track of assignments, quiz and the like

Thank Miscry for comparing this silly app to "a cozy tavern in the middle of a winter storm" <3

Please do play around and check out all the easter eggs ;)

Should be compatible to most browers and screen sizes
