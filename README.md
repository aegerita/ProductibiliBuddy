# Todo List
A web app for me to keep track of assignments, quiz and the like

Just started learning vue. hopefully i can add back-end to this stuff later

Still using vue2 for now, hopefully i can update this with vuex and vue3 before coop

## Update Dec 29 2020

Now I use vuex to store all your todos! Rejoice! <br>
Also, migrated from vue2 to vue3! With Composition API! <br>
What is a beautiful world in front of me ...

Todo list (meta)
- When todos have same title, drag and drop is confused. Stop that
- The tooltip plugin is not supported by vue3 anymore, must do it myself
- Optimize storage with vuex
- Make an achievement page for fun
- Backend with firebase or smth (stretch goal)
- Update messages according to achievement and activity (stretch goal)

## Functions

- Kindly greets you with random phrases
- Store todos in cookies
- Horizontal / Vertical layouts
- Undo / Redo
- Drag and drop (with html)
- Keyboard shortcuts & ~~Tooltips~~ (temporarily disabled)
    - undo: ctrl+z
    - redo: ctrl+shift+z
    - delete todo: right click
- Easter eggs

## Vue

somebody may ask: "why don't you learn react or angular?" 

well, they both look ugly, whereas vue looks amazing

**Aesthetics are EVERYTHING**
